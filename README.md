## Introducing MAE
MAE (Multi-purpose Annotation Environment) is an annotation tool originally created by [Amber Stubbs](http://amberstubbs.net) for Brandeis University for use in her dissertation research. It is a lightweight program written in Java, with a MySQLite database back end (SQLiteJDBC driver created by [David Crawshaw](http://www.zentus.com/sqlitejdbc/)).

MAE allows users to define their own annotation tasks, annotate partial words, use non-consuming tags, easily create links between annotations, and it outputs annotations in stand-off XML. While it does not enforce strict rules for annotation schemes, it is very easy to set up and start running.

## Download
Currently Keigh Rim ([krim at brandeis dot edu](mailto:krim@brandeis.edu)) is working on maintenance jobs and updating new features to MAE. The current release version of MAE is 0.12. You can download it by cloning the repository.

For the most recent, developing, and *unstable* version, use develop branch after cloning
    
    > cd mae-annotation
    > git checkout develop

## Requirements and Running
